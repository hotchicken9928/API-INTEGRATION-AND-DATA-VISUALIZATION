## Summary of the proogram that I have made - This is a Python-based program application that Integrated the OpenWeatherAPI recieved from the site and provides us with weatherforecast data of 5 days for a specific city(I have automated the API key and city name management throught the .env file for ease). We have used the python libraries and some basic requirements that are listed in the requirements.txt (which is present in this repo). The output recieved is in the form of a folder that generated itself as the output of the program and is a collection of the weather conditioons in the form of pictures in png format.I have used neovim as my IDE instead of vscode due to some compatibility issues of my laptop. The libraries used for this program are:requests, matplotlib, seaborn and python-dotenv. Requests: helps in establishing the interactoin between the api generation and the web requests that we make, Matplotlib: help in ploting the graps that are generated as an output of the pogram execution, Seaborn: this help in generating the line graphs or plots for graphs like the wind speed and humidity in the air, Python-dotenv: this performs the job of loading the variables form the .env flie into the os.environment.
